# Designs Directory

Architecture, UX/UI designs, and technical design documents.

## Structure

```
designs/
├── architecture/    # System architecture diagrams and docs
├── ux/             # UX/UI mockups, wireframes, user flows
└── database/       # Database schemas, ERDs
```

## Best Practices

- Use version-controlled design files (Markdown, SVG, etc.)
- Link designs to requirements and tickets
- Update designs when implementation reveals issues
- Get client sign-off on UX changes
